## How scoring works

The dashboard generates **two different scores**, each designed to answer a different fundraising question.

---

### 1. Review Priority Score

**Question:** *Which funders need research, cleanup, or follow-up first?*

This score helps identify records that are **important but incomplete, outdated, or unclear**.

A higher Review Priority Score means a funder should be reviewed sooner.

The score increases when:

* The funder is marked **High or Medium priority**
* The funder supports **multiple HII programs**
* Information has **not been updated recently**
* **Deadlines are missing or unclear**
* **Websites or application links are missing**
* Key fields like *What They Fund* or *Geography* are empty

This queue is best used for:

* Research days
* Data cleanup
* Strategic planning
* Delegating follow-ups to staff or interns

---

### 2. Application Priority Score

**Question:** *Which grants should we apply to next?*

This score is only calculated for funders that have **at least one known deadline**.

A higher Application Priority Score means the funder is a stronger near-term opportunity.

The score increases when:

* A deadline is **soon**
* The funder supports **multiple HII programs**
* The relationship is **warm or active**
* The funder is marked as a **higher priority**

The score is reduced when:

* The process is **invitation-only**
* The application is described as **complex or high-burden**
* The deadline has already passed

This queue is best used for:

* Weekly application planning
* Grant calendar reviews
* Deciding what *not* to apply to yet

---

### Why two scores?

Fundraising work happens in **two modes**:

1. **Research & preparation**
2. **Application & execution**

Separating these scores prevents urgent deadlines from hiding important strategic work — and prevents incomplete records from cluttering application planning.

### How to use the dashboard

* Start with **Apply Next** when planning submissions
* Use **Update Queue** to assign research and cleanup tasks
* Re-run the script after updating the Google Sheet to refresh priorities

The dashboard is designed to be **iterative** — scores improve as your data improves.
