We applied, but did not receive grant in 2024. Notes from Grants Manager James Bewley regarding our 2024 Application: ""The most significant issue with that proposal was the lack of information about the program itself and the artists involved. We view everything through the quality of the artists’ experience with an organization – so are they pushing their practice forward, making new work, making work in new ways or in collaboration with new partners, etc. It can take many forms. But aside from the structural overview and mission of the org, we need much more detail about the artists you’re bringing in, why besides an interest in climate are they interested in working with you – and what will they be doing. Specifics are really important here – from the criteria of selection to what the artists are being supported to produce or present. The first couple of paragraphs of the proposal can set the stage, with that organizational info – but the bulk of the proposal should be focused on the artists, their projects, and any other programs or activities you have planned (that remain connected to the visual arts) from July 1 forward for two years (with as much detail as you have – for at least nine months out). If you can pull that together, it will make for a more competitive proposal.""

These grants are made by The Carmack Collective team in consultation with our advisory board of movement leaders.

Exploratory Grants are a 1 year commitment of $10,000 each, given to first time grantees. They provide the opportunity to explore a mutual fit between The Carmack Collective and a new grantee over the 1 year period, and many Exploratory grantees advance to become Multi-Year grantees for one or more grant cycles.

Multi-Year Grants are a 3 year commitment that ranges from $10,000-$75,000/year. Long-term relationships are important to us, as we know that movement victories don’t happen overnight. As such, grantees may receive consecutive Multi-Year Grants.

With all of our Core Grants, we work to develop trust-based relationships with our grantees, engaging with them as true partners, and always centering their expertise and brilliance. For this reason we keep our application requirements to a minimum, do not require reporting, prioritize unrestricted grants, actively seek feedback from, and look to stand with our grantees in ways that go beyond the financial.

1.) Altering Political Discourse - Activities and grantees infuse the public narrative about the climate crisis with more equitable solutions identified by and for people disproportionately affected by climate change and the transition to clean energy.
2.) Advancing and Enforcing Climate-friendly Energy Policies and Regulatory Action - To help rapidly expand clean energy and technology deployment, activities center on educating policymakers, regulators, businesses, and consumers about the costs and benefits of existing and less-carbon intensive energy policy.
3.) Expanding Financing and the Climate Solutions Funding Community - We use our institutional voice to increase support from domestic and international funders for advancing equitable climate solutions, and we invest concessionary capital to help deploy clean energy and technology to communities that have or will be disproportionately impacted by the climate crisis.
4.) Supporting Power Building - To center racial, economic, and generational equity in conjunction with decarbonization, we support active participation of communities most affected by the climate crisis who have substantive contributions to make in shaping climate solutions. This approach includes both a cross-cutting dimension of the other three approaches as well as a stand-alone approach. In the United States, we focus on supporting community power building among BIPOC-led organizations and those representing rural communities that have been disproportionality affected by the transition to a clean energy economy. In India, activities are focused on capacity-building among organizations that may not focus exclusively or primarily on climate, as well as organizations representing workers’ and smallholder farmers’ interests. These activities are both a cross-cutting dimension of the other above-mentioned approaches as well as a stand-alone approach.","1. Dr. Michelle Kuo - Historian exploring the legacies of colonialism.
